# System Design Master Roadmap

This document serves as a structured index for learning System Design. Each section below is a placeholder for future, in-depth content.

## Part I: High-Level Design (HLD)

### Step 1: Fundamentals
- [ ] Serverless vs Serverful
- [ ] Horizontal vs Vertical Scaling
- [ ] What are threads
- [ ] What are pages
- [ ] How does the internet work?

### Step 2: Databases
- [ ] SQL vs NoSQL Databases
- [ ] In-memory Databases
- [ ] Data Replication & Migration
- [ ] Data Partitioning
- [ ] Sharding

### Step 3: Consistency vs Availability
- [ ] Data Consistency & its levels
- [ ] Isolation & its levels
- [ ] CAP Theorem

### Step 4: Caching
- [ ] What is Caching (Redis, Memcached)
- [ ] Write Policies: write back, write through, write around
- [ ] Replacement Policies: LRU, LFU, Segmented LRU etc
- [ ] Content Delivery Network (CDN)

### Step 5: Networking
- [ ] TCP vs UDP
- [ ] What is http(1/2/3) & https
- [ ] Web Sockets
- [ ] WebRTC & video streaming

### Step 6: Load Balancers
- [ ] Load Balancing Algorithms
- [ ] Consistent Hashing
- [ ] Proxy & Reverse Proxy
- [ ] Rate Limiting

### Step 7: Message Queues
- [ ] Asynchronous Processing (Kafka, RabbitMQ)
- [ ] Publisher-Subscriber Model

### Step 8: Monolithic vs Microservices
- [ ] Why Microservices?
- [ ] Concept of single Point of failure
- [ ] Avoiding Cascading Failures
- [ ] Containerization (Docker)
- [ ] Migration to Microservices

### Step 9: Monitoring & Logging
- [ ] Logging events & monitoring metrics
- [ ] Anomaly Detection

### Step 10: Security
- [ ] Tokens for auth
- [ ] SSO & OAuth
- [ ] Access Control lists & Rule Engines
- [ ] Encryption

### Step 11: System Design Tradeoffs
- [ ] Push vs Pull architecture
- [ ] Consistency vs Availability
- [ ] SQL vs NoSQL Databases
- [ ] Memory vs Latency
- [ ] Throughput vs Latency
- [ ] Accuracy vs Latency

### Step 12: Practice - HLD Problems
- [ ] youtube
- [ ] twitter
- [ ] whatsapp
- [ ] uber
- [ ] amazon
- [ ] dropbox / google drive
- [ ] netflix
- [ ] instagram
- [ ] zoom
- [ ] booking.com / Airbnb

## Part II: Low-Level Design (LLD) / Object-Oriented Design (OOD)

### Step 1: Object Oriented Programming
- [ ] Encapsulation
- [ ] Inheritance
- [ ] Polymorphism
- [ ] Abstraction
- [ ] SOLID Principles

### Step 2: Design Patterns
- [ ] Creational Patterns (Factory, Singleton, Builder, Prototype)
- [ ] Structural Patterns (Adapter, Bridge, Composite, Decorator, Facade, Flyweight, Proxy)
- [ ] Behavioral Patterns (Chain of Responsibility, Command, Iterator, Mediator, Memento, Observer, State, Strategy, Template Method, Visitor)

### Step 3: Consistency & Thread Safety
- [ ] Thread safe injection
- [ ] Locking Mechanisms
- [ ] Producer-Consumer Problem
- [ ] Race conditions & synchronization

### Step 4: UML Diagrams
- [ ] Class Diagrams
- [ ] Sequence Diagrams
- [ ] Use Case Diagrams
- [ ] Activity Diagrams

### Step 5: APIs & Code Structure
- [ ] API Design
- [ ] Request/Response Object Modeling
- [ ] Versioning & Extensibility
- [ ] Clean Code Principles: DRY, SRP
- [ ] Avoid God classes

### Step 6: Practice - LLD Problems
- [ ] Design a Tic-Tac-Toe game
- [ ] Design a Splitwise app
- [ ] Design a Parking Lot
- [ ] Design an Elevator System with multiple lifts
- [ ] Design a Notification System
- [ ] Design a Food Delivery app
- [ ] Design a Movie Ticket Booking System
- [ ] Design a URL Shortener
- [ ] Design a Logging Framework
- [ ] Design a Rate Limiter
