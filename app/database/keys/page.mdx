# 🔑 Various Types of Keys

- _What is a **primary key**?_
```text
A primary key is a field (or a set of fields) that uniquely identifies each record in a table.
It cannot contain NULL values, and each table can have only one primary key.
```

- _What is a **unique key**?_  
```text
A unique key ensures that all values in a column are different from one another.
Unlike a primary key, it can allow NULL values (usually one or more, depending on the database).
```

- _What is a **candidate key**?_  
```text
A candidate key is any column (or combination of columns) that can uniquely identify a row.
A table can have multiple candidate keys, but only one is selected as the primary key.
```

- _What is a **foreign key**?_  
```text
A foreign key is a field in one table that points to the primary key in another table.
It is used to create relationships between tables and maintain referential integrity.
```

- _What is a **composite key**?_  
```text
A composite key is a primary or candidate key made up of two or more columns.
The values in these columns together must be unique, even if the individual values are not.
```

| Key Type          | Uniqueness                  | NULL Allowed      | Main Purpose                              | Can Be Composite |
| ----------------- | --------------------------- | ----------------- | ----------------------------------------- | ---------------- |
| **Primary Key**   | Yes                         | No                | Uniquely identifies each record           | Yes              |
| **Unique Key**    | Yes                         | Yes (usually one) | Enforces uniqueness on a column           | Yes              |
| **Candidate Key** | Yes                         | Sometimes         | A possible choice for primary key         | Yes              |
| **Foreign Key**   | No (references another key) | Yes               | Links to primary key in another table     | Yes              |
| **Composite Key** | Yes                         | Sometimes         | Ensures uniqueness using multiple columns | Always           |
