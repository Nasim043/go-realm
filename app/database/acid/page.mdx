# 🧱 ACID Properties

- _What does **ACID** stand for?_  
```text
ACID is an acronym for Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, and Durability — the four key properties of a reliable transaction.
```
- _What is **Atomicity**?_
```text
Atomicity ensures that a transaction is completed as a single unit of work. If any part fails, the entire transaction is rolled back.
```
- _What is **Consistency**?_  
```text
Consistency ensures that a transaction leaves the database in a valid state, maintaining data integrity.
```
- _What is **Isolation**?_  
```text
Isolation ensures that concurrent transactions do not interfere with each other, maintaining data consistency.
```
- _What is **Durability**?_
```text
Durability ensures that once a transaction is committed, its changes are permanently saved, even in the event of a system failure.
