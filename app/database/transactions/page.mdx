# 🔐 Transactions

- _What is a **transaction** in a database?_  
```text
A transaction is a sequence of one or more SQL operations executed as a single unit of work.
Either all the operations are committed (saved) together, or none are applied (rolled back).
```
- _Why are transactions important?_  
```text
Transactions ensure data integrity, especially in multi-user environments.
They allow multiple related operations to be treated as one atomic action, avoiding partial updates.
```
- _What are the properties of a transaction?_
```text
ACID Properties:
- Atomicity: All operations succeed or none are applied.
- Consistency: Database state remains valid after transaction.
- Isolation: Transactions are isolated from each other.
- Durability: Changes are permanently saved.
```
**Example of Transaction:** 

```sql
BEGIN;

UPDATE Accounts SET balance = balance - 100 WHERE account_id = 1;
UPDATE Accounts SET balance = balance + 100 WHERE account_id = 2;

COMMIT;
```
