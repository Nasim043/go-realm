# ⚖️ Normalization

- _What is **normalization** in relational databases?_  
```text
Normalization is the process of organizing data in a database to reduce redundancy and improve data integrity.
```
- _What are different **normal forms** (1NF, 2NF, 3NF, BCNF)?_  

| Normal Form | Rule                                                                                 | Example                                                                      |
| ----------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **1NF**     | No repeating groups or arrays; each cell contains atomic (indivisible) values.       | A table with multiple phone numbers in one column should be split into rows. |
| **2NF**     | 1NF + no partial dependency on part of a composite key.                              | Order details table with product info split into separate product table.     |
| **3NF**     | 2NF + no transitive dependency (non-key columns depending on other non-key columns). | Customer city stored separately in `City` table instead of `Customer`.       |
| **BCNF**    | Stronger form of 3NF where every determinant is a candidate key.                     | Rare cases of overlapping candidate keys.                                    |

- _Why is normalization important?_  
```text
Normalization is important because it helps prevent data redundancy, reduces data duplication, and ensures data consistency. It also makes it easier to maintain and update the database.
```
- _Provide examples of normalized vs non-normalized tables._

**Example:**

```sql
-- Non-normalized table
CREATE TABLE Orders (
  id INT PRIMARY KEY,
  customer_id INT,
  order_date DATE,
  product_name VARCHAR(100),
  quantity INT,
  price DECIMAL(10, 2)
);

-- Normalized tables
CREATE TABLE Customers (
  id INT PRIMARY KEY,
  name VARCHAR(100),
  email VARCHAR(100)
);

CREATE TABLE Orders (
  id INT PRIMARY KEY,
  customer_id INT,
  order_date DATE,
  product_name VARCHAR(100),
  quantity INT,
  price DECIMAL(10, 2)
);
```
