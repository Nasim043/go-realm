# Go Realm

**Your journey into the Go programming language starts here.**

This documentation is a personal and practical guide, built as we learn and explore the world of Go (also known as Golang). It starts with the language fundamentals—syntax, data types, control structures—and gradually progresses to more advanced concepts like concurrency, interfaces, testing, and real-world projects.

Whether you're learning Go for the first time or reviewing the essentials, this guide is structured to grow with you. All examples and notes are written to be hands-on, readable, and immediately applicable.
