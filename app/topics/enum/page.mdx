# Enums in Go

Go doesn't have built-in enums, but they can be implemented using `iota` and custom types.

### Integer-Based Enums in Go

- Integer enums in Go are often created using `iota` to generate sequential values.
- `iota` is a special Go keyword that auto-increments values starting from 0.
#### 1. Day of the Week Enum

This enum represents days of the week in Go using `iota` for sequential integer values.

```go
type Day int

const (
    Monday    Day = iota // 0
    Tuesday              // 1
    Wednesday            // 2
    Thursday             // 3
    Friday               // 4
    Saturday             // 5
    Sunday               // 6
)
```

To use in Go code:

```go
func main() {
    var today Day = Tuesday
    fmt.Println(today) // Outputs: 1
}
```

Use this enum when you need to represent days of the week with integer values, such as in scheduling applications.

#### 2. **Status Enum**

This enum defines different statuses for a resource or user.

```go
type Status int

const (
    Pending Status = iota // 0
    Active                // 1
    Inactive              // 2
)
```

Example usage in Go:

```go
func main() {
    status := Active
    if status == Active {
        fmt.Println("System is active") // Outputs: System is active
    }
}
```

Useful for tracking the state of entities like users or tasks.

#### 3. **Priority Enum**

This enum represents task priorities.

```go
type Priority int

const (
    Low    Priority = iota // 0
    Medium                 // 1
    High                   // 2
)
```

Example in Go:

```go
func main() {
    taskPriority := High
    fmt.Printf("Task priority: %d\n", taskPriority) // Outputs: Task priority: 2
}
```

Use this for prioritizing tasks or jobs in a queue.


### String-Based Enums in Go
String enums are implemented using `string constants`, as Go doesnâ€™t have a native enum type for strings.

#### 4. **Color Enum**

This enum defines a set of colors as strings.

```go
type Color string

const (
    Red   Color = "Red"
    Green Color = "Green"
    Blue  Color = "Blue"
)
```

Example usage in Go:

```go
func main() {
    favoriteColor := Green
    fmt.Println(favoriteColor) // Outputs: Green
}
```

Ideal for scenarios where string representations are needed, like UI themes.

#### 5. **Role Enum**

This enum defines user roles in a system.

```go
type Role string

const (
    Admin Role = "Admin"
    User  Role = "User"
    Guest Role = "Guest"
)
```

Example in Go:

```go
func main() {
    userRole := Admin
    if userRole == Admin {
        fmt.Println("Access granted") // Outputs: Access granted
    }
}
```

Use this for role-based access control in applications.

#### 6. **Environment Enum**


This enum represents different deployment environments.

```go
type Environment string

const (
    Production  Environment = "Production"
    Staging     Environment = "Staging"
    Development Environment = "Development"
)
```

Example in Go:

```go
func main() {
    env := Development
    fmt.Println("Running in", env) // Outputs: Running in Development
}
```

Use this to configure application behavior based on the environment.
