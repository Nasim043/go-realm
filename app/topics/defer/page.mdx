<summary>Named Return Values</summary>

- Go's return values may be named
- These variables are automatically initialized to their zero values and can be used throughout the function.
- `A return statement without arguments` returns the named return values
- Named returns are **not the same** as function parameters
- Can still explicitly return values: `return x, y`
- All named values must be returned

### Basic Syntax

```go
func calculate(x, y int) (sum int, product int) {
    sum = x + y
    product = x * y
    // implicitly returns sum and product
    return // naked return
}
```

### Key Features

1. **Auto-initialization** - Variables are initialized to their zero values
2. **Naked returns** - Can use simple `return` statement without specifying values
3. **Documentation** - Makes return values self-documenting

### When to Use

✔ **Multiple return values** - Improves readability  
✔ **Deferred operations** - Useful with defer statements  
✔ **Long functions** - Makes return values clearer

### When to Avoid

✖ **Short, simple functions** - May be overkill  
✖ **When return values change often** - Can cause confusion

In Go (Golang), The defer keyword delays the execution of a function until the surrounding function completes.

### `defer`:
- The `defer` keyword delays the execution of a function **until the surrounding function completes**.
- Used for cleanup tasks (closing files, unlocking mutexes, etc.).
- **Execution Order**: Last-in, first-out (**LIFO**).
- They execute **after** the `return` statement is processed, but **before** the function actually exits.
- Arguments are evaluated immediately, not when the deferred function is executed.

### 📌 Basic Example:

```go
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
    fmt.Println("Start")

    defer fmt.Println("Deferred 1")
    defer fmt.Println("Deferred 2")

    fmt.Println("End")
}
```

### 🧠 Output:

```
Start
End
Deferred 2
Deferred 1
```

#### ⚠️ Important Note: Arguments are evaluated immediately

```go
func main() {
    x := 10
    defer fmt.Println("Deferred with x =", x)
    x = 20
}
```

**Output**:

```
Deferred with x = 10
```

Even though `x` becomes `20` later, `defer` uses its value at the time of deferral.

---

#### 🧪 Example 1: Multiple Defers (LIFO Order)

```go
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
    defer fmt.Println("First defer")
    defer fmt.Println("Second defer")
    defer fmt.Println("Third defer")
    fmt.Println("Main function")
}
```

**Output:**

```
Main function
Third defer
Second defer
First defer
```

🧠 **Why?** Because `defer` statements are executed in **reverse order** of how they were deferred.

---

### 🧪 Example 2: Defer in a Loop

```go
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
    for i := 1; i <= 3; i++ {
        defer fmt.Println("Deferred", i)
    }
}
```

**Output:**

```
Deferred 3
Deferred 2
Deferred 1
```

🧠 **Why?** Even though `i` changes, the `defer fmt.Println("Deferred", i)` **captures the current value at runtime**, not at execution — because it's not wrapped in a function. But watch this next case…

---

### 🧪 Example 3: Named Return vs Unnamed Return  
#### **✅ Named Return (Modifiable by `defer`)**  
```go
func namedReturn() (result int) {
    defer func() { result = 99 }()
    return 10  // Returns 99
}
```
**Output:** `99`  

#### **❌ Unnamed Return (Unaffected by `defer`)**  
```go
func unnamedReturn() int {
    result := 10
    defer func() { result = 99 }()
    return result  // Returns 10
}
```
**Output:** `10`

### 🧪 Example 4: Defer and Closures

```go
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
    for i := 1; i <= 3; i++ {
        defer func() {
            fmt.Println("Deferred inside closure:", i)
        }()
    }
}
```

**Output:**

```
Deferred inside closure: 4
Deferred inside closure: 4
Deferred inside closure: 4
```

🧠 **Why?**

- The deferred function is a **closure** that captures `i` by reference.
- After the loop ends, `i` becomes `4`, and then the closures run — all printing 4.
- To fix this, **pass `i` as a parameter** to the function:

```go
for i := 1; i <= 3; i++ {
    defer func(n int) {
        fmt.Println("Deferred with value:", n)
    }(i)
}
```

✅ Output:

```
Deferred with value: 3
Deferred with value: 2
Deferred with value: 1
```

### Key Behaviors
#### **(A) Arguments Evaluated Immediately**
```go
func main() {
    x := "Hello"
    defer fmt.Println(x) // "Hello" (evaluated now)
    x = "World"
}
```
**Output:**  
`Hello` (not `World`)

#### **(B) Works with Named Return Values**
```go
func count() (result int) {
    defer func() { result++ }()
    return 5 // Returns 6
}
```
**Output:**  
`6` (deferred function modifies `result`)
