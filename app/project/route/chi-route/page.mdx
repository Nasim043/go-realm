# 📘 Routing in Go Using Chi

Chi is a lightweight, idiomatic, and composable router for building HTTP services in Go. This guide outlines best practices for structuring and implementing both **public** and **protected** routes in a Go application using Chi.

## 📁 Project Structure

Organize your project to keep route management clean and maintainable. A recommended structure is:

```
/cmd
  └── main.go
/internal
  ├── routes/
  │     ├── public.go
  │     ├── private.go
  │     └── register.go
  ├── handler/
  │     ├── auth/
  │     │     ├── register.go
  │     │     └── login.go
  │     └── post/
  └── utils/
        └── auth.go
```

---

## 🔓 Public Routes

Define routes that do not require authentication (e.g., login, registration) in `public.go`:

```go
func PublicRoutes(r chi.Router) {
    r.Post("/register", auth.RegisterHandler)
    r.Post("/login", auth.LoginHandler)
    r.Post("/refresh", auth.RefreshHandler)

    r.Post("/forgot-password", auth.ForgotPasswordHandler)
    r.Post("/reset-password", auth.ResetPasswordHandler)
}
```

These endpoints are accessible without a token and are typically used for onboarding and recovery workflows.

---

## 🔒 Protected Routes

Use route grouping to apply middleware (such as authentication) only where needed. Define protected routes in `private.go`:

```go
func PrivateRoutes(r chi.Router) {
    r.Group(func(r chi.Router) {
        r.Use(utils.AuthMiddleware)

        r.Post("/change-password", auth.ChangePasswordHandler)
        r.Get("/users", auth.GetAllUsersHandler)
        r.Get("/user/{email}", auth.GetUserByEmailHandler)
    })
}
```

The middleware `utils.AuthMiddleware` ensures that all routes in this group are only accessible to authenticated users.

---

## 🔀 Combining Routes in `register.go`

In `register.go`, combine both public and protected routes for a unified setup:

```go
func RegisterRoutes(r chi.Router) {
    // Register public routes
    PublicRoutes(r)

    // Register protected routes
    PrivateRoutes(r)
}
```

---

## 🏁 Entry Point – `main.go`

Finally, wire everything together in your main application:

```go
func main() {
    r := chi.NewRouter()

    r.Use(middleware.Logger)
    r.Use(middleware.Recoverer)

    routes.RegisterRoutes(r)

    fmt.Println("Server running on http://localhost:8080")
    http.ListenAndServe(":8080", r)
}
```

This setup enables clean separation of concerns, security via middleware, and scalable route management as your application grows.

## ✅ Final Thoughts

* Use `chi.Group` to isolate middleware (auth, logging, role-based access).
* Separate route layers (`public`, `private`, `admin`) as your app scales.
* Keep handlers modular and organized under `/internal/handler`.


For more advanced features like rate limiting or versioning (`/api/v1`), Chi supports nesting groups and composing middleware effectively.
